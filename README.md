## Features

- **Unlimited Length Transcription**: Transcribe audio files of any length without limitations.
- **Support for Multiple Languages**: Choose from Hebrew, English, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, and Arabic for translation.
- **General and Hebrew Models**: Use either the general model (`large-v2`) for accurate timestamp generation or the specialized Hebrew model (`ivrit-ai/whisper-v2-d3-e3`) for improved Hebrew transcription.
- **Proportional Timings**: Accurate proportional timings based on the general model to ensure alignment with the actual audio length.
- **SRT File Generation**: Option to generate SRT files with synchronized subtitles.
- **HTML Paragraph Formatting**: Proper formatting of transcriptions and translations into paragraphs for better readability.
- **GPU Support**: Leverage GPU for faster transcription and translation if available.

## Usage

### Transcription and Translation

1. **Upload Audio File**: Click on the "Upload Audio File" button to select your audio file.
2. **Select Target Language**: Choose the desired language for translation from the dropdown menu. The default is set to Hebrew.
3. **Select Model Choice**: Choose between the "General Model" and the "Hebrew Model". The default is set to the "Hebrew Model".
4. **Generate SRT File**: Check the box if you want to generate an SRT file with subtitles.
5. **Submit**: Click the "Submit" button to start the transcription and translation process.

### Example

1. Upload an audio file (e.g., `example_audio.wav`).
2. Select "English" as the target language.
3. Select "General Model" to ensure accurate timing.
4. Optionally, check the "Generate Hebrew SRT File" box.
5. Click "Submit" to process the audio.

The output will display the transcription and translation in the chosen language, formatted into paragraphs for easy readability. If the SRT option is selected, an SRT file will also be generated and available for download.
